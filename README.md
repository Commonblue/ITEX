# ITEX

Francesca signficantly altered the labels in the raw DNA files. Making it impossible to work with this.
I need her to tell me how she fixed this for the thesis.

For hyphae in general.
I tried some early tests to see what works. Not too many effects added. But i noticed that the response is very dependant on site.
I wanted to see the effect overal and by site. I could not figure out how to do this using mixed effects etc.
So i found a way to use the effect size and look at it like a meta-analyses.

Michele says this is fine for a poster but maybe not for a paper. 
But form what i found this could be fit for a paper? (Maybe michele and i had some miscommunications?)

I will be continuing on working at the hyphae~warming using the meta-flor package, lookinng at it as a meta analyses.
Interesting: lmer result: OTC sign with a positive effect, Mega analyses: OTC sign with a negative effect.
the mixed effects models is very messy.
